Median Filter
=============

(a.k.a. **sliding window median** or **running median**)

Benchmarking median filter algorithms,
see: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/21730/74


Problem
-------

Input:

  - vector x with n elements
  - window size k

Output:

  - vector y with n-k+1 elements
  - y[i] is the median of x[i], x[i+1], ..., x[i+kâˆ’1].

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter


Algorithms
----------

  - "sort": O(n log k): sort blocks, do linear-time post-processing

  - "tree": O(n log k): maintain balanced search trees

  - "move": O(n k): maintain sorted vector


Compilation
-----------

The software is written in C++11. To compile it, you will need a
recent C++ compiler. For example, the following compilers should
work fine:

  - g++ (GCC 4.7.3 or later). Tested with these versions:

        g++-4.7 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-2ubuntu1~12.04) 4.7.3
        g++-4.8 (GCC) 4.8.2

  - clang++ (LLVM 3.4 or later). Tested with these versions:

        Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)

For OS X 10.9.2, you can get the right versions of the compilers
from the following sources:

  - clang++: from Apple
  - g++-4.8: from Homebrew

Depending on your C++ compiler and operating system, use one of
the following scripts to compile this software.

**OS X**:

  - "bin/build-clang": compiles with "clang++"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.8-osx": compiles with "g++-4.8"

**Linux**:

  - "bin/build-gcc": compiles with "g++"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.7": compiles with "g++-4.7"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.8": compiles with "g++-4.8"

You can also try to use "scons" to compile everything. The build
scripts are configured for OS X platforms that have both clang++
and g++-4.8 installed. You can get both scons and g++-4.8 from
Homebrew.


Versions
--------

  - build-clang-short: compiled with Clang, 32-bit data
  - build-clang-long: compiled with Clang, 64-bit data
  - build-gcc-short: compiled with GCC, 32-bit data
  - build-gcc-long: compiled with GCC, 64-bit data


Tools
-----

**verify**: does some sanity-checking and makes sure that all three
algorithms produce the same output. Use the command line parameter
for larger tests, and another parameter to skip the slowest
algorithm. Examples:

    build-gcc-short/verify
    build-gcc-short/verify 10
    build-gcc-short/verify 100 x

**tester**: benchmarking with different parameter values and
different input data generators. Run without command line parameters
for brief usage instructions.


Results
-------

Example:

    build-gcc-short/tester 10 500000 0 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 10 500000 1 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 10 500000 2 4 1

    build-gcc-short/tester 100000 5 0 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 100000 5 1 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 100000 5 2 4 1

    build-gcc-short/tester 1000000 5 0 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 1000000 5 1 4 1

    build-gcc-short/tester 10000000 5 0 4 1
    build-gcc-short/tester 10000000 5 1 4 1

Output:

    sort   10    500000   r-large   1   0.41762
    tree   10    500000   r-large   1   1.87928
    move   10    500000   r-large   1   0.58916

    sort   100000     5   r-large   1   0.10857
    tree   100000     5   r-large   1   1.28120
    move   100000     5   r-large   1   8.74902

    sort   1000000    5   r-large   1   1.66317
    tree   1000000    5   r-large   1   27.97039

    sort   10000000   5   r-large   1   25.30195
    tree   10000000   5   r-large   1   426.24067

Columns:

  - algorithm
  - h, the half-window size
  - b, the number of blocks
  - input data generator
  - random seed
  - time in seconds

Here window size is k = 2h + 1.
Input data is a vector with n = bk elements.


Plots
-----

**plot/summary-...**:

  - x axis: half-window size
  - y axis: running time
  - blue: "sort" algorithm
  - red: "tree" algorithm
  - black: "move" algorithm

**plot/speedup-...**:

  - x axis: half-window size
  - y axis: speedup of "sort" vs. "tree"

In each plot:

  - solid curve = median
  - shaded area = 10% ... 90% region
