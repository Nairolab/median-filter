Python implementation
=====================

This is a simple Python implementation of the sorting-based
median filter algorithm.

  - SortMedian.py: median filter
  - verify.py: a script for testing

This is pure Python; for example, numpy arrays are not used.
The goal is to make the source code as easy to follow as possible,
also for people who are not that familiar with Python.

For a more efficient implementation, see the C++ implementation
in ../src/SortMedian.cc.
